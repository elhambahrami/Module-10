# Module-10
1. n this Module I am going to do some aggregation on some columns of NYCHousing Maintenance Violation data set, first I make a data frame which by default it gives me 1000 rows which is enough for the purpose.
2. You can the data set thru the below link;
"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/wvxf-dwi5.csv"
3. I included a jupyter file which you can find Python codes for the aggregations.
